EWO (External Widget Object) Template

These files are a base framework for a new WinCC OA EWO embeddable into
any WinCC OA panel.
The tool newEWO in $API_ROOT creates a new EWO project
by creating implementation files based on these files

If cmake doesn't find a Qt version or you want to use a specific Qt version
you need to set CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH (environment) variable to the Qt location
(see https://doc.qt.io/qt-6/cmake-get-started.html).

What you have to do then is simply check all
// TODO
comments in the files and fill in your real implementations.

(Even without any modification you have already a compilable
 and runable new EWO, with 2 buttons and some signals/methods in it)

To install copy the compiled EWO with the name <yourProject>.ewo
into your projects "bin/widgets" or "bin/widgets/<OS>" directory
(where OS is one of:windows linux solaris)

See also the online doc for EWO details

Enjoy!
